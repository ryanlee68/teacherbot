# Teacherbot Overview
One of the main goals for the teacherbot is to connect people's discord ID to their GUSD 6-digit ID (student IDs).  This will be crucial in being able to successfully and easily take attendance.

## How to Connect Discord IDs to Student IDs
To connect student IDs to Discord IDs the teacherbot needs to take some "extreme" measure.  The bot is going to make it such that everyone who is not already in the database will automatically lose **ALL ACCESS** to server until they meet some certain conditions.  First and foremost, they must submit their student ID to the teacherbot.  After they submit their student ID they will be asked to confirm that the name corresponding to that student ID is correct.  Once all of the aforementioned steps are completed, they will then be given full access to the server.

## How to Make the Transition as Seamless as Possible
To make this process as seamless as possible anyone who is already in the bdaybot's database will be exempt from the losing access to the server (because we already have this person's ID).  If someone is not in the database then they will lose access to the server.  What exactly does lose access mean though?  Losing access means that all of their roles will be stripped and they will only be able to access two channels.  One of these channels will contain the instructions to regain access to the server and this channel will not be able to be spoken in.  Another channel will be the channel in which they submit their information.  There are two possible implementations for this.  We could give everyone their own private channel where they can message the bot and fill out the information.  This would lead to lots of channels and lots of clutter for the moderators who will be able to see every channel.  Since the majority of the people in the server **are not in the database** there will probably be around 100 or more private channels.  There will most likely be a limit on the number channels able to be created nonetheless the extreme clutter.  This will probably be the most user friendly option, however, we will need to ensure that this many channels can be created.  The second option is to have two channels in total for this process.  The first channel would be the instructions to gain access to the server again.  The second channel would be used to complete the instructions listed in the first channel.  This channel would be visible to everyone, however, people would only be able to type in the channel and not see the contents of the channel.  This is to prevent people from see other people's IDs.  Once the person has submitted their ID to this channel previously mentioned (the one they can type in but not actually see messages of) will receive a DM from the bot asking them to verify their name.  Once they make this confirmation they will regain full access to the server.
